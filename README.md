# Azure_Madness
PowerShell work with conditionalaccesspolicies and output from various gets using AzureRm.

Let me be real, the whole work of this was over a few days. It could be prettier.

The original output of the conditionalAccessPolicies from Azure wasn't done by me.
I was presented with the info and noticed the guids in the output but no resolution to user/group/etc.
This work was to resolve that information.
